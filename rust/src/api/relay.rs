//! The relay transport, backed by `nostr-sdk`'s relay pool.
//!
//! Thin on purpose, and shaped by the Dart interface above it
//! (`NostrRelayBackend`): connect, subscribe, publish to **one** relay and
//! report what *that relay* said. Reliability — the outbox, per-relay
//! convergence, the resend sweep — stays in Dart, where it was won (PRs #77,
//! #78). This module must never quietly acquire an opinion about any of it.
//!
//! The one thing worth understanding here is [`relay_publish`]: it asks a
//! single relay to take the event and reports whether **that** relay accepted.
//! `nostr-sdk`'s relay handle hands us that verdict structured — an `OK: false`
//! surfaces as its own error, distinct from a socket that simply never answered
//! — precisely what the hand-rolled transport had to grow OK-tracking to learn.
//! Flattening it back into a pool-wide "it worked" would resurrect the
//! stale-scoreboard bug.
