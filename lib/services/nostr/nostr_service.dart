///   stale scoreboard (#78).
/// - **Monotonic `created_at`** (I1): relays keep one event per
///   (kind, pubkey, d-tag) and, per NIP-01, a replacement needs a strictly
///   newer timestamp — on a tie the *old* event wins. Two scores in the same
///   second would otherwise leave the relay holding the earlier one.
/// - **Supersession**: only the newest state per match is ever resent. These
///   events are addressable; an older one is not history, it is noise.
